# Kepler-Data
Phase Folding Luminosity of Stars

A program run by QMUL to calculate the radius and orbital period of an exoplanet from the luminosity of the star it's orbiting.

*   Data used from the Kepler mission
*   Analyse and manipulate star luminosity data to produce the phase fold on the change in luminosity
*   Calculating the orbital period

*   Use phase fold to determine the length of time the star luminosity dips
*   Take luminosity dipping time as 1/2 an orbital period due to star visibility from sensors
*   Double luminosity dipping time to determine the orbital period

*   Calculating radius

*   Use phase fold to determine the percentage dip in the star's luminosity via exoplanet orbital cover
*   Use the percentage dip in the star's luminosity to calculate the radius of the exoplanet
*   Above uses the luminosity equation of star and planet to substitute for the radius
